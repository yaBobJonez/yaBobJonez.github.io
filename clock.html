    <h2>(not) FAQ:</h2>
    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>
        I feel like I've lost track of time quite a long time ago. I had graduated from school without a clear vision
        on my future so fast, then this f#cking war has begun. Sometimes I'm feeling stressed, down, or just too busy
        to notice the time flow. This tiny diary-like page shows what day is today in my head, as well as how much I
        lag behind.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the "Stable date"?</h3>
    <p>
        It may sound like all of this is made up for fun, IKR. Well, recently I've started mentally advancing my inner
        clock, getting better at time tracking. It takes a lot of... time. Y'know, sometimes you're feeling so bad, you
        want to either skip the day, or, in my case, return one day back. The stable date is the day I feel I've finally
        overcome, passed it, so it signifies the day before which I'll not revert my clock. Basically, days before the
        stable day are "in the past".
    </p>
    <h3>What is the "Next date"?</h3>
    <p>
        Again, it's all about my feelings. I may suddenly "leap ahead", skipping several days, if I feel it's... time
        to do so. The clock can thus advance several days, maybe even months, forward.
    </p>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
        Why are you reading it all then?
    </p>
    <h3>This page looks ugly.</h3>
    <p>
        I know, it has zero styling. The goal was not to create a beautiful website, anyway.
    </p>
    <h3>Are you seeking for help?</h3>
    <p>
        I've never said that. I don't need psychological aid, at least now. I just need some time to sort things out.
        Thank you for supporting me though :)

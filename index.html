        <h1>yaBobJonez's Index Page</h1>
        <p>
            Looks like you've been searching for my website, but, unfortunately, it is not finished yet.
            I'll be eventually making separate "modules" (e.g. Projects, About me, etc.) and only when most of them are
            done, I'll create the main/landing page here.
            At the moment, this page lists all such modules and some of my older websites (thus called the "index").
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>File</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="projects">projects/</a></td>
                <td>The "My Projects" module</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="personal">personal/</a></td>
                <td>The latest existing about me, available in EN, FR, RU, UK</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="uk">uk/</a></td>
                <td>Even older HTML/CSS CS school assignment (in Ukrainian)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="fluff">fluff/</a></td>
                <td>An ancient unfinished school CS group project site about furries</td>
            </tr>

                <td><a href="clock.html">clock.html</a></td>
                <td>The time inside my head</td>
            </tr>
